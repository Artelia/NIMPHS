NIMPHS
======

|  **N**\ umerous **I**\ nstruments to **M**\ anipulate and **P**\ ost-process **H**\ ydraulic **S**\ imulations.

|  This add-on makes possible to **import computational fluid dynamics files** (OpenFOAM and TELEMAC) in Blender.

|  Blender has a very **powerful photorealistic 3D renderer** and then can be used to render fluid dynamics simulations computed with
   OpenFOAM or TELEMAC-MASCARET. You can both **render still images and animations**!

.. note::

   |  The add-on **do not save the imported file in the Blender (.blend) file**. It only makes use of **temporary data**.

   |  Thus, every time you re-open a Blender file which was containing an OpenFOAM or a TELEMAC object,
      you will be asked to reload that temporary data (**make sure the path to these files are still correct!**).
